# MSCI-703 Applied Optimization

Here, I'm posting my assignments for the course MACI-703 Applied optimization. In this course I got familiar with some of the most important large-scale optimization problems as well as classic approaches in solving them. Some of these approaches include Lagrangian Relaxation, Dantzig-wolf decomposition, Benders decomposition, Branch and price approaches.

In my final project, I have selected a paper by Prof. Elhedhli on "The Pallet Loading Problem: Three-dimensional bin packing with practical constraints" and tried implementing approaches taught in the course to solve this problem.
